Manual História :

This is a world where powerful nations wage war and mighty heroes face off against one another.
The great nation of Brittannia seeks to unite the world through friendship and peaceful alliances. The European Union (EU) takes a cooperative stance, hoping to quelll the revolts that occur sporadically throughout their empire. Vinland, however, makes their business of the frequent wars throughout the world. The Eastern island nation of Zipang finds itself waist-deep in a swamp of internal conflicts that never seem to end.
